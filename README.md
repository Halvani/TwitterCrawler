# X (Twitter) Crawler

The notebook provides a basic but effective X (Twitter) crawler based on predefined X credetials (username + password). 
It makes use of the [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) framework and was tested with a [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). 

Currently, the crawler covers both tweet texts and image urls. In the near future, it will be extended with a variety of additional features.

Happy crawling!!
